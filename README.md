### Remove Name Dialog from User Profile

This theme component removes the user profile so that users cannot see it to 
edit it. Note that this merely hides this dialog from the UX, so it could be 
manipulated in the browser by a clever user.

The `auth overrides name` will enable an external authentication system to 
override the name, and may be used in conjunction with this component.
